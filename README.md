# Pitch-Detection-Using-AutoCorrelation

## Instructions for Running

  1. Run `recordSpeech.m`, to record speech sample. The speech signal is stored in `speech2.wav` file
  2. Run `pitchDetector.m` to compute the pitch of the signal stored in `speech2.wav`
  3. The pitch of the signal will be displayed in the Command Window.
     For eg:
     ```matlab
      The estimated pitch of the speech signal is 454.55 Hz
      The pitch of the speech signal (using MATLAB pitch function) is 400.00
     ```
      

Implemented based on the tutorial from [MATLABHelper](https://matlabhelper.com/blog/matlab/pitch-detection-of-speech-signal-using-autocorrelation-method-in-matlab/)
