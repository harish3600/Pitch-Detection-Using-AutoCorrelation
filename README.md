# Pitch-Detection-Using-AutoCorrelation

## Instructions for Running

  1. Run `recordSpeech.m`, to record speech sample. The speech signal is stored in `speech2.wav` file
  2. Run `pitchDetector.m` to compute the pitch of the signal stored in `speech2.wav`
  3. (DO WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THIS, pitch() fxn in matlab runs only .ogg files, so convert ur .wav to .ogg online. OR JUST USE OUR SPEECH SAMPLE ITSELF)
  4. The pitch of the signal will be displayed in the terminal

Implemented based on the tutorial from [MATLABHelper](https://matlabhelper.com/blog/matlab/pitch-detection-of-speech-signal-using-autocorrelation-method-in-matlab/)
